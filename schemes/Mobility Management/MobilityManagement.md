Our mobility management system was meticulously designed to ensure precise, reliable, and efficient control of the vehicle's movements throughout the competition. At the core of this system lies the integration of advanced Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technology, facilitated by an I2C interface, to manage motor speed and steering with exceptional precision. The use of PWM allowed us to make fine-tuned adjustments to the throttle and steering inputs, providing the vehicle with the agility needed to navigate sharp turns, accelerate smoothly, and maintain stability on challenging track surfaces. This level of control proved essential for meeting the rigorous demands of the freerun and obstacle segments of the WRO competition, where the ability to make real-time adjustments was critical to success.

To complement the PWM system, we implemented a high-performance drivetrain powered by a Li-Polymer Model 603048 battery, which supplied consistent energy to the vehicle's motors. This power source ensured that the vehicle had the strength to tackle varying terrain types while maintaining the endurance required for extended competition runs. The motors were calibrated to respond to the commands generated by the Raspberry Pi, which processed sensory data from the camera and gyroscope to dynamically adjust speed and steering angles based on the environment. This real-time feedback loop between the sensors and the control system allowed the vehicle to respond instantaneously to changes in the track, such as detecting obstacles or navigating tight curves.

One of the standout features of our mobility management system was the replacement of the stock RC car tires with high-traction, off-road tires. These enhanced tires significantly improved the vehicle's grip on the track, reducing slippage during high-speed maneuvers and allowing for sharper, more controlled turns. This upgrade not only improved the vehicle’s overall handling but also minimized energy loss, ensuring that power was efficiently transferred to the ground. The enhanced stability provided by the upgraded tires was particularly advantageous during the obstacle course segment, where precise movements were necessary to avoid collisions and maintain compliance with competition rules.

Our mobility management system was also engineered with energy efficiency in mind. By leveraging PWM, we were able to optimize the vehicle’s power consumption, extending battery life without compromising performance. This was crucial for maintaining consistent operation throughout multiple laps and ensuring the system remained reliable under competitive conditions. Additionally, the modular design of the vehicle allowed us to easily access and recalibrate mobility components during testing, enabling rapid iterations and performance enhancements.

The integration of advanced mobility technologies, including PWM motor control, high-traction tires, and a responsive drivetrain, resulted in a vehicle that was not only capable of precise and agile movements but also adaptable to a wide range of track conditions. This mobility management system was instrumental in allowing our vehicle to navigate the complex demands of the WRO competition with speed, accuracy, and efficiency, showcasing a sophisticated balance of engineering and innovation.
