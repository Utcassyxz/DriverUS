Our mobility management system was meticulously designed to ensure precise, reliable, and efficient control of the vehicle's movements throughout the competition. At the core of this system lies the integration of advanced Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technology, facilitated by an I2C interface, to manage motor speed and steering with exceptional precision. The use of PWM allowed us to make fine-tuned adjustments to the throttle and steering inputs, providing the vehicle with the agility needed to navigate sharp turns, accelerate smoothly, and maintain stability on challenging track surfaces. This level of control proved essential for meeting the rigorous demands of the freerun and obstacle segments of the WRO competition, where the ability to make real-time adjustments was critical to success.

To complement the PWM system, we implemented a high-performance drivetrain powered by a Li-Polymer Model 603048 battery, which supplied consistent energy to the vehicle's motors. This power source ensured that the vehicle had the strength to tackle varying terrain types while maintaining the endurance required for extended competition runs. The motors were calibrated to respond to the commands generated by the Raspberry Pi, which processed sensory data from the camera and gyroscope to dynamically adjust speed and steering angles based on the environment. This real-time feedback loop between the sensors and the control system allowed the vehicle to respond instantaneously to changes in the track, such as detecting obstacles or navigating tight curves.
