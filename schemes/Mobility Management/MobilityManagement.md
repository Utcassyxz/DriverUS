Our mobility management system was meticulously designed to ensure precise, reliable, and efficient control of the vehicle's movements throughout the competition. At the core of this system lies the integration of advanced Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technology, facilitated by an I2C interface, to manage motor speed and steering with exceptional precision. The use of PWM allowed us to make fine-tuned adjustments to the throttle and steering inputs, providing the vehicle with the agility needed to navigate sharp turns, accelerate smoothly, and maintain stability on challenging track surfaces. This level of control proved essential for meeting the rigorous demands of the freerun and obstacle segments of the WRO competition, where the ability to make real-time adjustments was critical to success.
