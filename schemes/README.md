# Electromechanical Diagrams and Component Descriptions

## **Electromechanical Diagrams**

Electromechanical diagrams for an AI RC Car incorporate a Raspberry Pi, PWM signals, and TensorFlow, illustrating connections and interactions between electrical and mechanical components. These diagrams are essential for designing, building, troubleshooting, and maintaining the car. Below is an overview of the key diagram types and their roles.

### **Types of Diagrams**

1. **Schematic Diagrams**  
   - Illustrate logical flow and connections of electrical components.  
   - Show how the Raspberry Pi connects to sensors, motor drivers, and the power supply, including PWM signal control for motors.

2. **Wiring Diagrams**  
   - Detail the physical connections and layout of wires and components.  
   - Highlight connections between sensors and Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, motor drivers to motors, and power supply distribution.

3. **Pictorial Diagrams**  
   - Use images or drawings to depict the physical appearance and arrangement of components.  
   - Include the placement of the Raspberry Pi, sensors, motor drivers, and the power supply in the RC car.

4. **Block Diagrams (Flowcharts)**  
   - Simplify the system into blocks representing functional sections, such as AI processing, sensor array, motor control, and power management.  
   - Provide a high-level overview of system operations without detailing wiring specifics.
