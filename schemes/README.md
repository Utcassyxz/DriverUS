# **Electromechanical Diagrams and Component Descriptions**

## **Electromechanical Diagrams**

Electromechanical diagrams for an AI RC Car incorporating a Raspberry Pi, PWM signals, and TensorFlow are essential tools for illustrating the connections and interactions between electrical and mechanical components. These diagrams aid in designing, building, troubleshooting, and maintaining the car. 

### **Types of Diagrams**

1. **Schematic Diagrams**  
   - Illustrate logical flow and connections of electrical components.  
   - For the AI RC Car, the schematic shows how the Raspberry Pi connects to sensors, motor drivers, and the power supply, including connections for PWM signals controlling the motors.  

2. **Wiring Diagrams**  
   - Detail the physical connections and layout of wires and components.  
   - Indicate how sensors connect to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, motor drivers to motors, and power supply distribution.

3. **Pictorial Diagrams**  
   - Use images or drawings to show physical appearance and arrangement of components within the RC car.  
   - Include the placement of the Raspberry Pi, sensors, motor drivers, and the power supply.

4. **Block Diagrams**  
   - Simplify the system into blocks representing functional sections, such as AI processing, sensor array, motor control, and power management.  
   - Provide an overview of system operations without detailing internal wiring.
