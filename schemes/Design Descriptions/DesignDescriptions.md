Design Description
=====

Our vehicle’s design represents a careful combination of mechanical engineering, AI development, and control system integration, with a strong emphasis on robust, modular, and _Self-Designed_ hardware. The platform for the vehicle is an RC car ([Bezgar Remote Control Car](https://bezgar.com/products/hp161s-brushless-rc-monster-truck?srsltid=AfmBOooFGoxjODbHSdft2b3kG1eCqt0nHd6ybDr41GkETmGHhnId5QGx8ZQ)), chosen for its durability, speed, and reliability in high-performance environments. This base provided a sturdy foundation for handling the demanding tasks of the WRO competition.

We designed a modular [LEGO](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego#:~:text=LEGO%20bricks%20are%20colorful%20plastic,building%20toy%20in%20the%20world.) structure mounted atop the RC car to securely house the essential hardware components. The LEGO construction was chosen for its adaptability and standardization of parts, allowing us to make iterative adjustments during testing phases. This modularity proved critical when fine-tuning the positioning of the camera, gyroscope, and Raspberry Pi, ensuring optimal performance across varied track conditions and lighting environments.

At the heart of the vehicle lies the [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/specifications/), which served as the central processing unit (CPU). It processes data from the camera and gyroscope in real time, running AI models to make instantaneous decisions. The Raspberry Pi was selected for its computational power, compact size, and support for advanced machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. Most of the code is located on the raspberry pi inside a hard drive (SD card) and is able to accessed easily

The vehicle is equipped with a [Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html), which provides a live video feed of the track. This feed is critical for the AI system to recognize track boundaries, detect obstacles, and make informed navigational decisions. The camera was mounted on an adjustable LEGO arm, enabling precise positioning.

The [WT901 gyroscope](https://witmotion-sensor.com/products/9-axis-accelerometer-tilt-sensor-wt901-high-accuracy-acceleration-gyroscope-angle-magnetometer-with-kalman-filtering-triaxial-mpu9250-ahrs-imu-iic-ttl-200hz-for-pc-android-arduino?srsltid=AfmBOoqfCXdqwgJ5OLrF-OszHW7Pc291yX24ZmS6GENK0HButTmnNTTE) was integrated into the system to monitor the vehicle’s orientation and angular velocity. This sensor played a key role in determining when to stop the vehicle after 3 laps and monitored orientation data throughout the run. 

To achieve precise control over the vehicle’s movements, we implemented Pulse Width Modulation ([PWM with ic2 interface](https://www.adafruit.com/product/815)) for motor management. PWM allowed fine-tuned adjustments to the vehicle's speed and steering. This control system was essential for the raspberry pi to assimilate with the RC car and control it. Additionally, PWM optimized power consumption, ensuring reliable performance throughout extended competition runs.

To improve performance, the stock RC car tires were replaced with high-traction, off-road tires. These upgraded tires provided enhanced stability and grip on track surface and allowed it to make sharp turns without accidentally drifting off-course. 

By integrating these carefully selected hardware components into a cohesive design, our vehicle was able to handle the rigorous challenges of the WRO competition, demonstrating exceptional adaptability and performance in real-world scenarios.
