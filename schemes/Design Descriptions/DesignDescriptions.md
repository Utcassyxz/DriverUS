Our vehicle's design is a testament to the meticulous integration of mechanical engineering, advanced artificial intelligence, and control systems, all built with a focus on robust, modular, and self-designed hardware. At the foundation of the design is the Bezgar RC car platform, carefully chosen for its durability, speed, and proven reliability in high-performance environments. This base served as a sturdy framework for handling the multifaceted challenges of the WRO Future Engineers competition. Mounted atop the RC car is a custom-built LEGO structure, designed to house critical hardware components such as the Raspberry Pi, camera, and gyroscope. The choice of LEGO for the mounting system provided unmatched flexibility, allowing us to make iterative adjustments to component placement during extensive testing and development phases. This adaptability was critical to optimizing the vehicle's performance across varying track conditions and lighting environments, ensuring peak efficiency during competition.
