Our vehicle's design is a testament to the meticulous integration of mechanical engineering, advanced artificial intelligence, and control systems, all built with a focus on robust, modular, and self-designed hardware. At the foundation of the design is the Bezgar RC car platform, carefully chosen for its durability, speed, and proven reliability in high-performance environments. This base served as a sturdy framework for handling the multifaceted challenges of the WRO Future Engineers competition. Mounted atop the RC car is a custom-built LEGO structure, designed to house critical hardware components such as the Raspberry Pi, camera, and gyroscope. The choice of LEGO for the mounting system provided unmatched flexibility, allowing us to make iterative adjustments to component placement during extensive testing and development phases. This adaptability was critical to optimizing the vehicle's performance across varying track conditions and lighting environments, ensuring peak efficiency during competition.
At the heart of the vehicle’s intelligence lies the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which serves as the central processing unit. This device was chosen for its exceptional computational capabilities, compact design, and compatibility with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow. Acting as the command center for the vehicle, the Raspberry Pi processes real-time data from a Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 and a WT901 gyroscope. The camera, mounted on an adjustable LEGO arm, captures a live video feed of the track, enabling the AI model to recognize boundaries, detect obstacles, and make rapid navigational decisions. The gyroscope, on the other hand, ensures that the vehicle maintains proper orientation, monitors angular velocity, and precisely determines when to stop after completing designated laps. Together, these components form a cohesive sensory system that allows the vehicle to operate autonomously and adaptively in a dynamic environment.
To control the vehicle's movements with precision, we employed Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) through an I2C interface for motor management. This technology enabled fine-tuned adjustments to the vehicle’s speed and steering, ensuring precise handling even during sharp turns and sudden directional changes. The integration of PWM not only optimized power consumption but also bridged the compatibility gap between the RC car and the Raspberry Pi, allowing seamless control of the vehicle's mechanical functions. To further enhance performance, the stock RC car tires were replaced with high-traction, off-road tires. These upgraded tires provided superior stability and grip, enabling the vehicle to maintain control on challenging track surfaces and execute sharp maneuvers without drifting off course.
