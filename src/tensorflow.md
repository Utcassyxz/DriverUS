## Applications of TensorFlow in Our Robotics Project

### **1. Autonomous Navigation**
- TensorFlow processes data from the Pi camera to predict steering angles and throttle values.
- By training models with data collected from test runs, TensorFlow enables the robot to navigate autonomously in dynamic environments.

### **2. Obstacle Avoidance**
- TensorFlow's machine learning models detect obstacles in the vehicle's path, calculate their distance, and adjust steering to avoid collisions.
- This capability ensures safety and efficiency during operation.

### **3. Parking Assistance**
- TensorFlow identifies designated parking zones using trained image recognition models.
- It then assists the vehicle in slowing down, aligning, and stopping accurately.

### **4. Continuous Model Improvement**
- TensorFlow's iterative training process allows us to refine the AI model with new data, enhancing its performance over time.
- The integration of TensorFlow with GPUs has accelerated this process, enabling rapid development cycles.
