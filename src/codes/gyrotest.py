'''
This program reads Z-axis angular velocity data from a WT901 gyroscope via I2C communication and calculates the yaw angle by 
integrating the gyroscope data over time (calculus concept). It includes:

Initialization: I2C communication setup, sensor address, and registers are defined.

Gyroscope Reading Function: Captures raw gyroscope data, processes it into degrees per second (dps), and handles the scaling.

Main Loop:
Reads gyro data.
Computes time differences between readings.
Updates yaw angle based on angular velocity and time elapsed.
Outputs the yaw angle in real-time.

Graceful Exit: Safely terminates on user interruption (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C)
