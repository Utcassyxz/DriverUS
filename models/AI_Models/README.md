# Trained AI Models

This folder contains examples of our trained AI models specifically designed for our autonomous vehicle. These models are critical for enabling the vehicle to interpret camera inputs and determine appropriate throttle and steering actions, ensuring smooth and accurate navigation.

## Overview of Models

### **1. [model_freerunccw10](model_freerunccw10)**  
- **Purpose**: Enables the vehicle to navigate a freerun course in a counter-clockwise direction.  
- **Key Features**: Optimized for smooth turning and consistent speed in counter-clockwise motion.  

### **2. [model_freeruncw5](model_freeruncw5)**  
- **Purpose**: Facilitates the vehicle's navigation on a freerun course in a clockwise direction.  
- **Key Features**: Data trained early on, is choppy and unsmooth but is able to complete a run
