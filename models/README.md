## **3D Modeling and Building Instructions**

The 3D_Models folder on GitHub contains a detailed 3D model of the LEGO car component and comprehensive building instructions for the structure. To access and view these resources, follow the steps below:

**Viewing the 3D Lego Model**
1. Download the future engineers.lxf file from the 3D_Models folder.
2. Install [LEGO Digital Designer](https://lego-digital-designer.en.softonic.com) to open the .lxf file.
3. Once installed, use LEGO Digital Designer to explore the 3D model in detail.

**Viewing the Building Instructions**
1. Download the "[Building Instructions (future engineers) - images](https://github.com/Utcassyxz/USA-Future-Engineers---DriverUS/tree/9608d30e230236a254943df41e74102f1177d6cf/models/3D_Models/Building%20Instructions%20%5Bfuture%20engineers%5D-images)"
folder from GitHub. This folder contains all the images necessary for the instructions.
3. Unzip the folder and place it in your computer's Downloads directory.
4. Download the "[Building instructions (future engineers).html](https://github.com/Utcassyxz/USA-Future-Engineers---DriverUS/blob/03f3972be36e6e3378cd324e298ca619069e46aa/models/3D_Models/Building%20Instructions%20%5Bfuture%20engineers%5D.html)" file.
5. Open the HTML file (located in your Downloads folder) in your browser. This will generate an interactive website with the building instructions.

The website provides an intuitive experience with:
* **Step-by-step guidance**: Each step includes the required LEGO pieces and a clear assembly process.
* **Interactive features**: Navigate smoothly between steps and access additional information.
* **Printing option**: Print the instructions if needed.
* **Piece inventory**: A complete list of required LEGO pieces is included at the end of the instructions.
* **[PDF](https://github.com/Utcassyxz/USA-Future-Engineers---DriverUS/blob/1332f71c22e0ab700d1a64ad2a66b8dad052e8a7/models/3D_Models/Lego%20Building%20Instructions.pdf)**: A pdf of the building instructions is attached in the 3D_Models folder but it is best to view them on our coded website for a better experience

**Example of the Building Instructions**
Below is a preview of what the building instructions look like:

## **AI_Models**

The AI_Models folder on Github contains some of the trained AI models that our group has trained and used to run the vehicle. To access and run these resources, follow the steps below: 

**Downloading and Running the Models**
1. Download the model as is onto your computer
2. Transport the model using FileZilla or a equivalent software onto the raspberry pi
3. Write a program using python or a equalivalent software on the raspberry pi that can run a keras interpreter
4. Call the transported AI model in the program and run it
5. Fine tune your throttle and steering values until the AI model matches up with your own vehicle
6. Make sure the camera is set to a position such that the model is effective
7. Remember the models we uploaded were trained using data from our own car it might not respond well with your own vehicles

It is important to point out that the models we uploaded aren't the final models we use for the competition and may be imcomplete or inaccurate. The point of the models are purely for demonstration purposes and the below are the final statistics for our models. 

**Final Model Counts**

* Freerun CW - | Estimated training time - 
* Freerun CCW - | Estimated training time - 
* Obstacle Run CW - | Estimated training time - 
* Obstacle Run CCW - | Estimated training time - 
* Parking CW - | Estimated training time -
* Parking CCW - | Estimated training time - 

Estimated training time is taken into account the amount of time to record the data, transfer it to the computer, and train an AI model. We use the estimation of 15 minutes for one set of data not including the setup and charging times.
