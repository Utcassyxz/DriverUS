## **3D Modeling and Building Instructions**

The 3D_Models folder on GitHub contains a detailed 3D model of the LEGO car component and comprehensive building instructions for the structure. To access and view these resources, follow the steps below:

**Viewing the 3D Lego Model**
1. Download the future engineers.lxf file from the 3D_Models folder.
2. Install [LEGO Digital Designer](https://lego-digital-designer.en.softonic.com) to open the .lxf file.
3. Once installed, use LEGO Digital Designer to explore the 3D model in detail.

**Viewing the Building Instructions**
1. Download the "[Building Instructions (future engineers) - images](models/3D_Models/Building Instructions (future engineers)-images)"
folder from GitHub. This folder contains all the images necessary for the instructions.
3. Unzip the folder and place it in your computer's Downloads directory.
4. Download the "Building instructions [future engineers].html" file.
5. Open the HTML file (located in your Downloads folder) in your browser. This will generate an interactive website with the building instructions.

The website provides an intuitive experience with:
* **Step-by-step guidance**: Each step includes the required LEGO pieces and a clear assembly process.
* **Interactive features**: Navigate smoothly between steps and access additional information.
* **Printing option**: Print the instructions if needed.
* **Piece inventory**: A complete list of required LEGO pieces is included at the end of the instructions.
* **PDF**: A pdf of the building instructions is attached in the 3D_Models folder but it is best to view them on our coded website for a better experience

**Example of the Building Instructions**
Below is a preview of what the building instructions look like:
