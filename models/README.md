Located in the 3D_Models folder, the model section for the Github includes both a 3D model for the lego component of the car and building instructions for the structure. To download and view the 3D lego model (future engineers.lxf), you must download lego digital designer using this link: https://lego-digital-designer.en.softonic.com. 

To view the building instructions you must first download the folder "Building Instructions [future engineers] - images" which contain all the images for the instructions. Then unzip the folder and make sure its located in the downloads section of your computer. Finally download the "Building instructions [future engineers].html" file and in downloads click on the file and it should open up a website generated by the html. The website should contain the building instructions along with interactive features that allows for a smooth experience. 

The lego building instructions is coded so that each step will have the required pieces and a option to print the instructions. The very back of the model includes a list of the required pieces and the building instructions is clear-cut and well defined for navigation and precision. A example image of the building instructions is located below:
